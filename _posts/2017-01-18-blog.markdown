description: <a href="/blog">ReallyWhat</a> is a blog I keep to document and share my experience in data science. Recently I challenged myself to produce something ever day for 100 days. So far I have used machine learning methods from Scikit-learn to enter Kaggle competitions, explored data with Python in Jupyter Notebooks, and produced beautiful data visualizations in D3.
