description: <a href="/blog">Blog</a> is used to document and share my experience in data science. Recently I challenged myself to produce something ever day for 100 days. This is called this the <a href="/blog/tag/100daysofcode">100DaysOfCode</a> challenge. So far I have used machine learning methods from Scikit-learn to enter Kaggle competitions, explored data with Python in Jupyter Notebooks, and produced beautiful data visualizations in D3.
