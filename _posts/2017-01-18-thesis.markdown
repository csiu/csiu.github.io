description: <h4>Characterization of the normal thyroid reference epigenome</h4>In my thesis work, we compare the consistency of chromatin state annotations across the epigenomes from the grossly uninvolved tumour-adjacent thyroid tissue of 4 human individuals using ChIP-sequencing and RNA-sequencing data. We examine 6 histone modifications, identify chromatin states using hidden Markov models, produce a new metric for model selection, and establish epigenomic maps of 19 chromatin states.
