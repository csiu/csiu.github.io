                  I am passionate about Data Science, Machine Learning, and
                  Data Visualization.
                  I am currently working on a
                  <a href     ="/blog/tag/100daysofcode/">100 days of code</a>
                  challenge producing and sharing work related to data science
                  ever day for 100 days. I am also on the organizing committee
                  for <a href ="http://www.hackseq.com">hackseq</a>,
                  a genomics hackathon in October.

                  Previously I worked on the classification of tissue types
                  using neural networks, the modelling of epigenetic states
                  in the human thyroid, and literature-based
                  knowledge discovery in biomedical text.

               I completed a MSc in Computational Biology at the
               <a href        ="http://bcbioinformaticsgrad.ca">University
                 of British Columbia</a> and worked as a
               Bioinformatics Research Assistant at the
               <a href="http://compbio.bccrc.ca/people/">BC Cancer Agency</a>
               for a year before starting my Master's. I am co-authored in
               3 publications in the general field of Bioinformatics with
               1 more publication accepted and 2 more in review.
             </p>
             <p>
               I volunteered to help out at Software Carpentry workshops and
               am always interested in new opportunities.
